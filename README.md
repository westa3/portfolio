# Personal Portfolio Website

Hi! 👋  
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, built with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Vite**.

It’s a place where I share a bit about myself - my background, experience, projects, skills, awards and interests - all in a clean, modular and thoughtfully designed space.

I’m actively working on and refining projects so feel free to check back for updates as new work gets added. If something here resonates with you, I’d love to connect!

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ava-west/)
